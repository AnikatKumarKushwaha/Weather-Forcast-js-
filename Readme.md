# WEATHER FORECAST

---

## Description

This weather application fetches current weather and a 5-day forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to search for a city's weather or use their current location, displaying results dynamically. Recent searches are saved and updated in local storage, maintaining a list of the last five searches. A loading spinner indicates data fetching, and error messages are displayed via a popup for invalid city names or connection issues. The UI includes a dropdown for selecting recent searches and dynamically updates with new data.
